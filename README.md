# RST-levelup
Tool chain to transform exports

transforms excel reports from M+ to an mpx. Update of an earlier version of this toolchain written in perl.

cd AmerikaSM/20190726
lvlup.py

The script creates several subdirectories which document whats going on under the hood

0-IN: has original excel files
1-XML: has excel tables simply transformed to xml. I call this format stupid xml because of several shortcomings
2-MPX: de-multiplied using xsl 
3-FIX: various fixes using xsl. Contains end result produced by lvlup.py. 

Input: lvlup.py expects one of three documents
-sammlungsobjekte: so.xsl, 
-multimediaobjekte: mm.xsl, 
-personenKÃ¶rperschaften: pk.xsl

If you want to re-trigger the process, delete the corresponding files, e.g. if you want to retrigger the initial conversion to xml,
delete the output files in 1-XML.
