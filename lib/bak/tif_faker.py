Resource information faker for tifs.

We have tifs that are not really documented in the database. This utility 
could gather information on them and present them in a data format (xlsx, xml).
TifId.py is already doing something like that while working with the original 
tifs (at their original location).

Right now I am thinking of the same thing, but working on tifs on their temp 
location inside the levelup workflow. That might be less efficient. Perhaps
best to join the two processes together.
