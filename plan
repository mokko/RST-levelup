Input

cd data/AmerikaSM/20190725
-so.xls (optional)
-mm.xls (optional)
-pk.xls (optional)
0-In <-- save input files to document what has been done
1-Xml <-- stupid xml, as well as joined version. This version is potentially dirty (i.e. has false multiplies
2-Clean <-- demultiplied version (formerly called lvl2)
3-Fix
levelup.log

Logfile has details on the conversion process, incl. the date of transformation. 


where do i store config info? At first in master script.
Do I really need logging at first? no

1. xls2xml
 1.1 mkdir 1-XML und 0-IN if not exists already
 1.2 move existing input files to 0-IN
 1.3 py-transform to dirty xml in 1-XML if target does not exist already. 
     If you want to repeat conversion, delete corresponding files in 1-IN
 1.4 Log success/failure in logfile; not necessary at first
2. join input files and write to 2-XML/join.mpx using java saxon via python subprocess
3. Demultiply
 3.1 mkdir 2-CLEAN if doesnt exist yet
 3.2 make clean (lvl2) version using java saxon via python subprocess 
4. Rinse and repeat for fix xsl
 Why is fix necessary at the moment?

disadvatage needs java installed

OO syntax not really necessary here, but who cares 

o=xls2xml(conf) or xls2xml(conf)

for f in conf.infiles
   print (f)
try os.path.isfile(file_path)

import os
if not os.path.exists(directory):
    os.makedirs(directory)
