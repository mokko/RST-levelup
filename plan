-pk.xls (optional)
0-In <-- save input files to document what has been done
1-Xml <-- stupid xml, as well as joined version. This version is potentially dirty (i.e. has false multiplies
2-Clean <-- demultiplied version (formerly called lvl2)
3-Fix
levelup.log

Logfile has details on the conversion process, incl. the date of transformation. 


where do i store config info? At first in master script.
Do I really need logging at first? no

1. xls2xml
 1.1 mkdir 1-XML und 0-IN if not exists already
 1.2 move existing input files to 0-IN
 1.3 py-transform to dirty xml in 1-XML if target does not exist already. 
     If you want to repeat conversion, delete corresponding files in 1-IN
 1.4 Log success/failure in logfile
2. join input files and write to 2-XML/join.mpx using java saxon via python subprocess
3. Demultiply
 3.1 mkdir 2-CLEAN if doesnt exist yet
 3.2 make clean (lvl2) version using java saxon via python subprocess 
4. Rinse and repeat for fix xsl
 Why is fix necessary at the moment?
