Logfile has details on the conversion process, incl. the date of transformation. 


where do i store config info? At first in master script.

1. xls2xml
 1.1 mkdir 1-XML und 0-IN if not exists already
 1.2 move existing input files to 0-IN
 1.3 transform to dirty xml in 1-XML if target does not exist already. 
     If you want to repeat conversion, delete corresponding files in 1-IN
 1.4 Log success/failure in logfile
2. join input files and write to 2-XML/join
